# nates_code
collection of code templates from my projects and the web.

Download the git repo and navigate to the directory.

Install using: pip install .

Then call the template functions like a normal python package.

These template functions are meant to be printed in Jupyter Notebook and appear as follows:

![](examples/example_usage.png?raw=true)


The printed text can then be copied and pasted into code cells.
