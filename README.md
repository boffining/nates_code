# nates_code
Collection of code templates from my projects and the web. The purpose of this package is to make my code easier to find and eliminate multiple versions of notebooks. This package serves both as a repo and scratchpad for my projects.

Download the git repo and navigate to the directory.
Install using: pip install .

Then call the template functions like a normal python package.
These template functions are meant to be printed in Jupyter Notebook and appear as follows:

![](examples/example_usage.png?raw=true)

The printed text can then be copied and pasted into code cells.
